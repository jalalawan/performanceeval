# sensortoolkit_env.yml
# File can create a conda virtual environment on user's device and downloads python-3.8, most up-to-date sensortoolkit version,
# spyder packages (for using spyder IDE), and other pinned dependent package versions.
# Assumes the user has downloaded Miniconda or Anaconda and Spyder IDE

# Download this file to the root of your project directory and navigate to your project directory so your command line interface (CLI) looks similar to below (assuming "toucan_evaluation" is the name of your project directory)
# C:\Users\...\Documents\toucan_evaluation>

# To use this file (sensortoolkit_env.yml) to create a conda virtual environment and download pinned packages, in CLI type in:
# conda env create -f sensortoolkit_env.yml

# To properly use the environment it must be activated before sensortoolkit is used. IF PACKAGES WITHIN THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT ARE TO BE ADDED/REMOVED/MODIFIED THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT MUST BE ACTIVATED.
# To activate virtual environment, in CLI type in:
# conda activate stk-env

# When activated, the virtual environment name enclosed in parenthesis will appear in your CLI as shown below: 
# (stk-env) C:\Users\...\Documents\toucan_evaluation>

# Before running an analysis with sensortoolkit, make sure you modify your IDEâ€™s Python interpreter to point to the /python.exe file within the stk-env virtual environment.
# To find the path of /python.exe within the virtual environment, open up your CLI and make sure the Conda virtual environment is activated. If using windows, in your CLI, type in "where python".
# Copy the path of the /python.exe in the stk-env virtual environment. It should be located at a path that looks something like C:\Users\...\Miniconda3\envs\stk-env\python.exe (if you have Miniconda installed).
# If using Spyder IDE, paste this path into the Spyder python interpreter (Tools>Preferences>Python Interpreter>Use the following Python interpreter: [Insert path]). Then, restart the IDE.

# To deactivate the conda virtual environment, in CLI type in the following command:
# conda deactivate
