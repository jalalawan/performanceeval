Background:

- Guidance on low-cost sensor siting, deployment, and performance evaluation is recent and evolving (latest information in Enhanced Air Sensors Guidebook, 2022) which is used as the basis for this work.

From review of LCS Literature:

- Lack of long-term performance evaluations against reference monitors (typically > 1-year deployment) 
- “Multiple Deployments” refer to at least 3 sensors deployed in at least 2 cities and/or 2 EPA Regions
- Collocation refers to sensors located within ~6 miles and at a ± 1m height with an FRM / FEM
    - Average distance in SM is ~15 miles from FRM/FEM monitors recording (and sharing) PM, R.H, and Temp at hourly resolution
    - Less distance (~5 miles) between FRM / LCS sensors in PGH.
- Fundamental safeguards for the use of sensors (even for NSIM* applications) should include protocols that address data handling and initial processing, outlier detection and removal, data QA/QC for both FRM/LCS, and data completeness checks.
